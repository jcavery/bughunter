1. spider for urls containing parameters (parse out dupe params)
2. dump full urls to a text file
3. append urls with xss payloads
4. test urls (ZAP/looking for 200s)
5. dump HTTP 200s to a text file
6. manually inspect urls for xss (response time, response body size. bigger the better, that's what she said.)
